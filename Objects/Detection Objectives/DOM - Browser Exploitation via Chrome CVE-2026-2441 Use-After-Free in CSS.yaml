    Detect exploitation of CVE-2026-2441, a use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome's CSS engine
    that enables remote code execution via crafted HTML pages. This actively exploited zero-day
    allows threat actors to achieve arbitrary code execution within the browser sandbox, potentially
    leading to data theft, credential harvesting, or as a stepping stone for full system compromise.

    The detection objective focuses on identifying malicious browser activity patterns, suspicious
    process behaviors, and network indicators associated with exploitation attempts targeting
    unpatched Chrome installations (versions prior to 145.0.7632.75).

  composition:
    strategy: Combined
    description: |
      Detection signals work together to provide multi-layered coverage across the attack chain.
      Network-based signals detect delivery of malicious pages, process-based signals identify
      exploitation artifacts, and behavioral signals catch post-exploitation activity. Combined
      approach reduces false positives while maintaining high detection confidence.

  signals:
    - name: Chrome Process Crash with Memory Corruption Indicators
      uuid: 2f83ab03-12ee-4379-a648-e6444675eb91
      description: |
        Detects Chrome browser crashes potentially indicative of exploitation attempts. Use-after-free
        vulnerabilities typically cause memory corruption that may result in process termination. While
        crashes can be benign, patterns of crashes on specific pages or unusual crash reports may indicate
        active exploitation. This signal focuses on chrome.exe crashes with error codes or crash dump
        characteristics associated with memory corruption (access violations, heap corruption).
      severity: Medium
      effort: 2
      methodology: Behavioural
      data:
        availability: Partial
        requirements: |
          - Windows Event Logs (Application log, Event ID 1000/1001 for application crashes)
          - Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation) to correlate crashed processes
          - Optional: Windows Error Reporting crash dumps
          - Optional: Chrome crash telemetry if centrally collected

    - name: Chrome Spawning Unexpected Child Processes
      uuid: d010b507-616f-4265-8b99-597a53ddc393
      description: |
        Identifies chrome.exe spawning child processes that are uncommon for normal browser operation.
        Successful exploitation within the sandbox may lead to attempts to execute additional code or
        escape containment. Suspicious child processes include cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe,
        cscript.exe, or other scripting/execution utilities not typically spawned by Chrome during
        normal web browsing. Excludes known legitimate Chrome child processes like chrome.exe itself
        (multi-process architecture), crashpad_handler.exe, and software_reporter_tool.exe.
      severity: High

    - name: Network Connection to Newly Registered or Low-Reputation Domains
      uuid: 5472e9b5-1bf5-497f-9472-a2026463bb2c
      description: |
        Detects Chrome browser connections to domains with low reputation scores, newly registered
        domains (registered within last 30-90 days), or domains using suspicious TLDs commonly
        associated with malicious infrastructure. Exploit delivery often leverages compromised
        legitimate sites or newly created attacker-controlled domains. This signal correlates
        Chrome network connections with threat intelligence feeds and domain reputation services
        to identify potentially malicious C2 or exploit delivery infrastructure.
      severity: Medium

          - Threat intelligence feeds (domain reputation, newly registered domains)

    - name: Chrome Accessing Unusual File System Locations
      uuid: 6ed5d84f-95cc-4228-9a6d-91452b5b8588
      description: |
        Identifies Chrome process accessing file system paths outside of its normal operational
        directories. Typical Chrome file access is limited to user profile directories, cache,
        cookies, extensions, and download folders. Access to system directories (Windows\\System32,
        ProgramData), administrative shares, or attempts to write to executable directories may
        indicate post-exploitation activity such as payload staging, persistence establishment,
        or lateral movement preparation.

    - name: Suspicious Browser Extension Installation or Modification
      uuid: f107753a-dd10-4c26-a945-498abd3f453d
      description: |
        Detects installation or modification of Chrome browser extensions outside of normal user-
        initiated workflows. Post-exploitation persistence may involve installing malicious
        extensions to maintain access, intercept credentials, or exfiltrate data. This signal
        monitors for unexpected changes to Chrome's extension directories, registry keys associated
        with extension policies, or API calls related to extension installation not preceded by
        user interaction with Chrome Web Store.

        availability: Partial
        requirements: |
