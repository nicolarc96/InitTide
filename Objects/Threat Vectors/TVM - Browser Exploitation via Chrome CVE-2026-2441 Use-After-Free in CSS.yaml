    CVE-2026-2441 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome's CSS rendering engine, actively exploited 
    in the wild before public disclosure. The vulnerability allows remote attackers to achieve arbitrary code 
    execution within the browser sandbox via specially crafted HTML pages containing malicious CSS.

    The attack begins with delivery of crafted HTML pages through drive-by compromise (watering hole attacks) 
    or targeted phishing campaigns. When a victim using vulnerable Chrome versions (prior to 145.0.7632.75) 
    navigates to the malicious page, the CSS triggers a use-after-free condition in the rendering engine, 
    allowing the attacker to gain control of program execution flow within the sandbox.

    Whilst the immediate impact is limited to sandbox-level code execution, this typically serves as the first 
    stage in a full system compromise. Sophisticated threat actors often chain browser exploits with sandbox 
    escape techniques to achieve unrestricted access to the victim system, credential theft, and data exfiltration.

    Detection opportunities exist across multiple layers: network-based detection of malicious domains, 
    endpoint-based detection of Chrome crashes and suspicious child processes, and behavioral detection 
    of abnormal browser file system access patterns. However, detection is challenging as exploitation 
    occurs within browser processes with limited host-based indicators.

  description: |
    CVE-2026-2441 represents a critical use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome's CSS rendering engine that 
    was actively exploited as a zero-day before patch availability. The vulnerability enables remote code 
    execution within the browser sandbox through crafted HTML pages, requiring only user navigation to a 
    malicious URL with no additional user interaction needed.

    Google acknowledged active exploitation but witeld details on threat actors and targets, suggesting 
    sophisticated threat activity potentially targeting high-value individuals or organisations. The rapid 
    two-day window between discovery and patch release indicates the severity and active exploitation status.

    This threat vector exemplifies modern browser exploitation techniques where initial access is achieved 
    through memory corruption vulnerabilities, providing a foothold for further exploitation including 
    sandbox escape, credential harvesting, and persistent implant deployment.
