    This threat vector represents a commercial mobile spyware platform distributed via social engineering 
    and fake app marketplaces, targeting both Android (versions 5-16) and iOS (up to version 26) devices. 
    The malware is generated through a builder tool provided to buyers, who then deploy the malicious binaries 
    along with a self-hosted management panel.

    Upon infection, the spyware establishes comprehensive device profiling capabilities, extracting device model, 
    location coordinates, operating system details, battery status, SIM information, carrier details, application 
    usage patterns, and notification data. The panel provides real-time GPS coordinates plotted on Google Maps 
    with historical location tracking, effectively converting infected devices into surveillance platforms.

    The malware incorporates advanced collection capabilities including keystroke logging, SMS message interception 
    (including OTPs to bypass two-factor authentication), and enumeration of all accounts registered on the device 
    (Google, WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Telegram, Amazon, payment platforms). Live surveillance is enabled 
    through real-time camera streaming and microphone feeds, allowing remote monitoring of victims.

    For financial theft, the spyware scans for cryptocurrency wallet applications (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Binance, 
    Coinbase) and implements clipboard manipulation to redirect transactions to attacker-controlled wallets. An 
    additional bank stealer module targets mobile wallet platforms including Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, and 
    Indian UPI-based payment applications like PhonePe.

    On iOS, the malware leverages enterprise provisioning capabilities that allow app installation without App Store 
    publication, bypassing traditional distribution controls. This cross-platform support, combined with active 
    development and Telegram-based sales infrastructure, represents a significant commoditisation of previously 
    nation-state-level mobile surveillance capabilities.

    ZeroDayRAT is a commercial cross-platform mobile spyware platform advertised on Telegram that enables 
    comprehensive device surveillance and financial theft on Android and iOS devices. The platform provides 
    buyers with a malware builder and self-hosted management panel, offering capabilities including real-time 
    GPS tracking, keystroke logging, SMS interception (including OTPs), account enumeration, live camera and 
    microphone streaming, cryptocurrency wallet manipulation, and banking credential theft. Distributed via 
    social engineering and fake app marketplaces, the spyware exemplifies the commoditisation of sophisticated 
    mobile surveillance capabilities previously limited to nation-state actors, making comprehensive mobile 
    compromise accessible to a broader range of threat actors through a commercial offering.
