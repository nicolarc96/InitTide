8f88da38-ac40-4c93-b7b0-696ec02cea7a,Phishing Delivery via LNK File Executing MSHTA to Deploy HTA-Embedded DLL Payload,Threat Vectors,clear,"This threat vector represents a sophisticated multi-stage infection chain employed by Pakistan-aligned 
APT groups to compromise Indian defense and government entities. The attack begins with a spearphishing 
email containing a malicious LNK file disguised as a legitimate document. When executed by the victim, 
the LNK file leverages mshta.exe to retrieve and execute an HTA file from attacker-controlled infrastructure.

The HTA file contains JavaScript code that decrypts and loads an embedded DLL payload, which subsequently 
writes a decoy PDF to disk, establishes C2 communication, and displays the decoy to the user. Before 
deploying the final payload (Geta RAT), the malware performs security software discovery to adapt its 
persistence mechanism, demonstrating defense-aware behaviour.

The technique's effectiveness stems from combining social engineering, abuse of trusted system binaries 
(Living Off The Land), multi-stage execution, and dynamic evasion techniques. The use of compromised 
legitimate domains for payload hosting further reduces detection probability and increases victim trust.

cb0a2cd0-510b-412b-9d79-2fe5394b15b3,Browser Exploitation via Chrome CVE-2026-2441 Use-After-Free in CSS,Threat Vectors,amber,"CVE-2026-2441 represents a critical use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome's CSS rendering engine that 
was actively exploited as a zero-day before patch availability. The vulnerability enables remote code 
execution within the browser sandbox through crafted HTML pages, requiring only user navigation to a 
malicious URL with no additional user interaction needed.

Google acknowledged active exploitation but witeld details on threat actors and targets, suggesting 
sophisticated threat activity potentially targeting high-value individuals or organisations. The rapid 
two-day window between discovery and patch release indicates the severity and active exploitation status.

This threat vector exemplifies modern browser exploitation techniques where initial access is achieved 
through memory corruption vulnerabilities, providing a foothold for further exploitation including 
sandbox escape, credential harvesting, and persistent implant deployment.

comprehensive device surveillance and financial theft on Android and iOS devices. The platform provides 
buyers with a malware builder and self-hosted management panel, offering capabilities including real-time 
GPS tracking, keystroke logging, SMS interception (including OTPs), account enumeration, live camera and 
microphone streaming, cryptocurrency wallet manipulation, and banking credential theft. Distributed via 
social engineering and fake app marketplaces, the spyware exemplifies the commoditisation of sophisticated 
mobile surveillance capabilities previously limited to nation-state actors, making comprehensive mobile 
compromise accessible to a broader range of threat actors through a commercial offering.

web browsing operations. This detection targets post-exploitation activity associated with
CVE-2026-2441, a use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome's CSS engine enabling sandboxed remote
code execution.

Chrome's multi-process architecture normally spawns only specific child processes (chrome.exe
instances for renderers/GPU, crashpad_handler.exe for crash reporting, software_reporter_tool.exe
for cleanup). Execution of scripting utilities (cmd.exe, powershell.exe, wscript.exe, cscript.exe)
or other system binaries indicates potential exploitation and sandbox escape attempts.

This rule filters out legitimate Chrome child processes while alerting on high-risk execution
patterns that suggest compromise.

parent process chain indicates LNK file interaction. This detection identifies the initial execution 
vector where malicious shortcut files invoke mshta.exe to retrieve and execute remote HTA payloads.

The detection focuses on identifying mshta.exe process creation events with command-line arguments 
pointing to remote URLs (http/https), particularly when the parent process is explorer.exe. This 
pattern is highly indicative of malicious LNK files being used as an initial access vector.

Key indicators monitored:
- mshta.exe process creation
- Parent process is explorer.exe (shell context)
- Command line contains HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- Process spawned in user context (not system services)

This detection is part of a multi-stage detection objective covering the complete attack chain 
from phishing delivery through post-exploitation activities.
