The attack begins with a spearphishing \nemail containing a malicious LNK file disguised as a legitimate document. When executed by the victim, \nthe LNK file leverages mshta.exe to retrieve and execute an HTA file from attacker-controlled infrastructure.\n\nThe HTA file contains JavaScript code that decrypts and loads an embedded DLL payload, which subsequently \nwrites a decoy PDF to disk, establishes C2 communication, and displays the decoy to the user. Before \ndeploying the final payload (Geta RAT), the malware performs security software discovery to adapt its \npersistence mechanism, demonstrating defense-aware behaviour.\n\nThe technique's effectiveness stems from combining social engineering, abuse of trusted system binaries \n(Living Off The Land), multi-stage execution, and dynamic evasion techniques. The use of compromised \nlegitimate domains for payload hosting further reduces detection probability and increases victim trust.\n"
