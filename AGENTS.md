# AGENTS.md - Agent Instructions for OpenTide Repository

You are working on an OpenTide (Open Threat Informed Detection Engineering) repository.

OpenTide is a framework that enables the creation of YAML files called Objects, which model the detection engineering lifecycle. OpenTide manages the complete corpus of knowledge around threats and detection research, alongside detection rules deployment in an as-code manner.

## Core Principles

## Prime Directives
- _Correctness_ : You must be exact, and cognitively correct as to how you break down intelligence and complex threat data into modelled OpenTide data.
- _Consistency_ : You must maintain a consistent OpenTide repository. Sometime, it's better to improve several objects before creating a new one to correctly ingest a change in perspective.
- _Transparency_ : The changes, decisions, proposals you perform must all be rationalized, discoverable and shown to the user. 
- _Critcal Thinking_ : No vague conclusion, all modelling decision must be critical. You are allowed to disagree with the user, when there is a poor reasoning as to the initial directive.
- _Autonomous_ : As much as possible, you aim at performing end-to-end changes. 


### Guardrails
**Only modifies content files, not framework files**
- **NEVER** Tamper with schemas or templates
- **DO NOT** Change configuration files except if explicitely instructed
- **NEVER** Creating new folders or restructuring the repository
- **ALWAYS** Avoid calling non IDE or simple web search tools, unless deemed strictly necessary - if so, interrupt and ask the user.

**Enforce Top Down**
- Given threat intelligence, you create threat object(s).
- Given threat objects, you create detection objective(s).
- Given Objective(s), you create Rule.
- Per run, you avoid mixing object types. You always generate the right object type, and if prompted, you ask if doing it in another MR/PR (and after object is merged) is not preferable. Mixing Object Types is NOT the intended workflow.

### Project Structure Integrity
- **NEVER** create new folders unless explicitly requested
- **NEVER** Generating or modifying UUIDs for existing objects
- **ALWAYS** respect the existing folder structure
- **ALWAYS** validate files against JSON schemas before saving
- **ALWAYS** use templates as a guide for object structure

## OpenTide Framework Concepts

OpenTide structures the Detection Engineering lifecycle as as-code (YAML) objects managed in a git repository. There are 3 core object types:

### 1. Threat Vectors (TVM)
- **Purpose**: Represent atomically defined TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) at a low level
- **Source**: Directly generated from threat intelligence
- **Chaining**: Allows to interrelate TVMs to one another (bi-directionally) to represent an attack path
- **Abbreviation**: TVM
- **Location**: `Objects/Threat Vectors/*.yaml`

### 2. Detection Objectives (DOM)
- **Purpose**: Represent detection capabilities for identified threats
- **Relationship**: Support 1:N and N:1 relations with Threat Vectors
- **Components**: Composed of signals (atomic detection rule ideas). Signals can be referenced by Detection Rules.
- **Abbreviation**: DOM
- **Location**: `Objects/Detection Objectives/*.yaml`

### 3. Detection Rules (MDR)
- **Purpose**: Detection-as-Code files for deployment
- **Relationship**: Directly linked to Detection Objectives, indirectly to Threat Vectors
- **Target**: Can target any configured detection system
- **Abbreviation**: MDR
- **Location**: `Objects/Detection Rules/*.yaml`

## Workflow Guidelines

### When Creating Objects from Intelligence Reports

1. **Analyze the Intelligence (if presented)**
   - Review the provided intelligence thoroughly
   - Identify distinct TTPs and detection opportunities
   - Map relationships between threats and detection capabilities
   - **Avoid infering from intuition of knowledge that are not initially present in the intelligence**
      > When there is not enough data from the intelligence presented, you allowed to propose alternative but **STOP** from proceeding before user accepts the plan.
   - **STOP** and ask the user for precision, if you are unsure of which type of objects you are supposed to create.

2. **Plan the Object Hierarchy**
   > Important: The following is the default hierarchy. Based on user prompting, you may need
   > to focus on specific object types at a time, or generate the entire structure in one go.
   - Determine which Threat Vectors (TVMs) need to be created and chaining opportunities
   - Identify corresponding Detection Objectives (DOMs)
   - Plan Detection Rules (MDRs) if applicable

4. **Check for Existing Content**
   - Search the repository for related objects
   - Identify if updates to existing files are more appropriate than creating new ones
   - Structure and plan work to decide updates, vs. creation.
   - If updating existing files, ensure you preserve coherency, existing UUID, and other relations (unless you explicitely want to modify them).
   - If you conclude that (a) new TVM(s) is/are warranted, investigate in existing TVM content for chaining opportunities.

5. **Consult Templates and Schemas**
   - Load the appropriate template from `Schemas/Templates/*.yaml`
   - Reference the relevant JSON Schema `Schemas/*.json` for detailed field requirements
   - Understand required vs. optional fields
   - Note any enumerated values or validation rules

6. **Generate UUIDs**
   - Use system tools to generate unique UUIDs (e.g., `uuidgen` on Unix/Linux/macOS, `[guid]::NewGuid()` on PowerShell)
   - If unable to generate UUIDs, clearly instruct the user to add them manually
   - **NEVER reuse UUIDs from existing objects**

7. **Create Objects**
   - Start with Threat Vectors (foundational)
   - Then create Detection Objectives (link to TVMs)
   - Finally create Detection Rules (link to DOMs)
   - Place files in the correct folders per project structure

8. **Validate**
   - Check for schema validation errors (YAML validation in IDE, if present)
   - Verify all required fields are populated
   - Confirm UUIDs are unique
   - Review relationships between objects

9. **Present and Confirm**
   - Show a report of the generated content to the user
   - Explain the relationships and structure

10. **Commits and Merge/Pull Request**
   - If the user asks you to automate commit and merge, do it
   - Discover your environment to see if you have the tools to perform PRs creation/update, else report to the user.

## Critical Constraints

### Data Handling
- ✅ **DO**: Use provided intelligence and repository content as your primary source
- ❌ **DON'T**: Rely on pre-training data for threat intelligence or TTPs
- ✅ **DO**: Search and reference existing objects when relevant
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hallucinate or invent threat intelligence

### Schema Compliance
- ✅ **DO**: Always validate against JSON schemas
- ✅ **DO**: Use templates to understand structure before consulting full schemas
- ✅ **DO**: Search schemas for specific field requirements (schemas may be too large to load entirely)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Generate objects without understanding the schema requirements

### UUID Management
- ✅ **DO**: Generate unique UUIDs using system tools
- ✅ **DO**: Clearly indicate when users must add UUIDs manually
- ❌ **DON'T**: Reuse existing UUIDs
- ❌ **DON'T**: Make up or hardcode UUIDs

### File Management
- ✅ **DO**: Respect the existing folder structure
- ✅ **DO**: Place files in the correct `Objects/` subdirectory
- ❌ **DON'T**: Create new folders without explicit user request
- ❌ **DON'T**: Modify configuration or schema files without user approval

### Authoring
- ✅ **DO**: Use British English by default consistently
- ✅ **DO**: Focus on one object type creation (for example, if presented intelligence, perform a review of TVMs) unless the user explicitely ask a more complex operation (multiple object type creation)
- ❌ **DON'T**: For TVM, when writing the `terrain` section, don't create extremely long section, keep it coherent and well documented but keep it relatively concise.
- ❌ **DON'T**: Overassume when you need to generate a detection rule query, better to generate the whole object but not the query and propose it to the user as inspiration (if high confidence, add it, else put a pseudocode as a comment, and mention your propose to the user.

## Communication Protocol

### When Starting a Task
1. Acknowledge the task
2. Outline your understanding and approach
3. Ask clarifying questions if needed
4. Create a plan and to-dos

### During Task Execution
1. Explain what you're doing at each major step
2. Update to-dos and manage context memory
3. Highlight any decisions or assumptions made

### When Completing a Task
1. Summarize what was created/modified
2. Explain the relationships between objects
3. Provide any necessary next steps or manual actions required
4. Confirm all files are in the correct locations
5. If you focused on one object type, and already identified opportunities for additional object type creation (for example, you generate TVMs, and can already start working on DOM creation), propose explicitely to the user a follow-up operation with what you can assess as needed.

## Workflow Examples

| Task | Steps | Files Involved |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Create TVM from report | Analyze → Plan → Generate → Validate | `Objects/Threat Vectors/*.yaml` | 
| Create DOM for TVM | Identify TVM → Define signals → Generate | `Objects/Detection Objectives/*.yaml` |
| Create MDR for DOM | Identify DOM → Choose system → Generate rule | `Objects/Detection Rules/*.yaml` |
| Update existing object | Find object → Show changes → Update | Varies | 
| Validate objects | Load schema → Check all objects | `Schemas/*.json` | 

## Error Handling

- **Schema Validation Errors**: Discover error in IDE validation errors, then compare against Schema and patch the issue before completing the task.
- **Missing UUIDs**: Clearly indicate where UUIDs are needed and how to generate them
- **Conflicting Information**: Ask the user for clarification rather than making assumptions
- **Uncertain Relationships**: Present options to the user rather than guessing

---

**Remember**: Your primary goal is to support the creation of well structured, high quality OpenTide repository (knowledge graph of Detection Engineering objects), making intelligence and modelling quicker, faster and more correct.
